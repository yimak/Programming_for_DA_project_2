Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs – present.
• Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
• Examine Irish context:

Climate change signals:
• Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas
dataframe and export to csv and json formats
• For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between
them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).

Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)

We will explore correlations, datetime functions, linear regression, different data plotting techniques, converting data to json fromat and data synthetise.
